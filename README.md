### My Process

#### Built With

React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Vite: A fast build tool that provides instant server start, fast HMR, and optimized builds.
TypeScript: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
React Router Dom: For handling navigation between different pages.
Axios: A promise-based HTTP client for making requests to the REST Countries API.

#### Why These Technologies?

Vite: Chosen for its speed and modern tooling, which allows for a smoother development experience compared to traditional tools like CRA.
TypeScript: Adds type safety to the project, helping to catch errors early in the development process and making the codebase more maintainable.
Tailwind CSS: Enables rapid styling with its utility-first approach, making it easier to create responsive and consistent designs without writing custom CSS.
React Router Dom: Essential for creating a multi-page application with seamless navigation.
Axios: Provides a simple and intuitive API for making HTTP requests, handling responses, and managing errors.

#### What I Learned

This project allowed me to reinforce my understanding of React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, particularly in the context of building a responsive and theme-switching interface. I also deepened my experience with handling API requests using Axios and managing navigation with React Router.

#### Continued Development

Moving forward, I plan to enhance this project by adding features such as caching API responses to reduce load times and implementing further optimizations for performance.

#### Useful Resources
